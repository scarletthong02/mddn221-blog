            <a class="sub-heading">Assignment Presentation</a>
            <p class="blog-text">In this week's class we did presentations of our assignment 2-1 to get some feedback before the hand in. Over the past week I worked on finalizing the block wireframes that I had made and began to develop a hi-fi wireframe of my home page by adding my fonts, colors, and images the feedback that I got from this was to make the search the search bar appear more obvious and to make it smaller, and to fix the scale of everything in general. This was valuable feedback to use to make my website look more visually affective and cohesive.  </p>
            <a class="sub-heading">CSS Grids pt.2</a>
            <p class="blog-text">The prerecorded lecture continued upon the content surrounding CSS grids, building on the knowledge from the last lecture. This week mostly focused on creating responsive design that would adjust according to the viewing screen size. We showed the same process of setting up a display 
                :grid in css and the adding a min/max screen size to give boundaries for when the layout would adjust to fit the desired screen size. This is done fairly easily by setting the values you want and then re-writing the grid-template-areas in a new body{} for the layout that you want. This function of CSS is useful as it shows a quick way to create a responsive design that is accessible on all types of devices. This is definitely useful to me as a web designer as it is a technique, I would use on site I am coding to make sure that they would work on different platforms. There is nothing more frustrating than a poorly designed mobile website. </p>
            <a class="sub-heading">Typography</a>
            <p class="blog-text">The lecture covered typography. After taking typography 201 last trimester I was already fairly confident with my knowledge of using typography, but I was useful to get a sense of how to use it within web design. The lecture covered typography like line spacing, font colour and size, types of fonts, how typography can create a hierarchy or add/change the mood or aesthetic of a site. From this lecture I took in that in web design it is imperative to have legible typography particularly for elements like buttons. This is something that I will definitely pay more attention to in the future and particularly for this website. </p>
