            <a class="sub-heading">Assignment Development</a>
            <p class="blog-text">As this is the last few weeks of the year, I have had heaps of hand-ins and been super busy, so I knew I had to get started with coding my blog as soon as possible. I knew that I wanted to create a simple but still visually pleasing blog as I had stitched myself up by not starting this sooner. I started this process by going through all the prerecorded lecture content to remind myself of all the coding we covered. I also looked at YouTube tutorials and other online examples of blog code. I decided that for my main page I just wanted a header image and a grid to display a preview of each blog post, and then have separate page for each post. I started by creating the html part of the code made a header for the nav bar and sections for the main title segment and blog posts segment. For the blog post section, I made several divs for each post I then went on to CSS to make the visual design, I added a custom font from adobe fonts, by using the @import function, I tried adding a downloaded font, but I still don’t know why I couldn’t get this to show up on my website. I then made a grid for the blog posts using display:grid, and then after some googling I found the easiest way to make this responsive was grid-template-colums: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px,350px)) which would fit as many blog boxes at a min/max width of 300/350px as possible on the screen size, so the number of columns would shrink/grow depending on the screen size. I was doing this coding late at night, so honestly, I do not really have a rhyme or reason as to why I did what I did, but in my html, I created a bunch of classes for each element of the blog boxes. I found that by doing this I did not have to individually code each of my blog boxes, and it would apply the visual design to each of the items in the class. I then went on to add in images and colours. I was not sure the colour palette I wanted to use, so I made variables of the colour hex codes as I thought I would want to change this later, and by doing so I wouldn’t have to go in and individually change each time I applied the colour but just the variable value. I played around with hover states, sizing, and appearance of everything until I got it how I wanted. I then made the nav bar. Originally, I wanted to make a logo, but thought that it would make more sense just to have a home button as a blog logo does not make sense, I also added a button to link to my design Instagram. For the footer I just added my name and course details. I then created the pages of each individual blog post; I created one and then copied and pasted this 12 times and renamed and linked each of these. The blog pages are fairly simple with just an image and text, but this was really all that was really necessary. The image going over the header background was actually on accident, I don’t actually know how that happened, but I ended up like the way it looked as it added more contrast and visual interest, so I didn’t try to change it. I wanted a way to navigate between these pages easier other than having to go back to the home page each time, so I made a previous and next button at the bottom of the page that would link to the respective blog post. And that was pretty much the blog done. </p>
            <p class="blog-text">This was a super valuable experience coding a blog. It felt like jumping into the deep end, but ended up being far easier than I expected. The entire process is actually much less confusing than I was anticipating (although I did have to refer to online guides several times) This makes me quite motivated and I want to expand my knowledge feel like I could move on to coding something a bit more complex next, perhaps some passion project over the summer. </p>
