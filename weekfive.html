            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">For class today we had a working session for assignment one however I did not get to work much on it as I was busy with my assignments for other classes. The lecture video covered CSS Grids. Once again, I had pretty much no knowledge of what this was, but the video was helpful in explaining this. Grids in css is essentially a layout system using rows and columns to organise objects on a web page, it is helpful when splitting the page up into sections like a header, a main section and a footer as well as side menus and splitting up the main section. This video explained how to set up a display:grid with CSS and linking elements from html to CSS starting with creating a 1x column and 3x rows page with a heading, main and footer sections, then went more in depth with creating a grid within a grid, by creating a grid inside the nav bar and main section. At first this was overwhelming as there was a lot of added information and numbers on the screen but after watching the video it seemed pretty simple. It was good that when you are defining the elements withing the grid, you are already typing it out in a grid format, which I thought was helpful in visualising and planning code into an actual page. We then learnt how to use the ‘nth’ number to link all the elements within a grid without having to name each part individually, which I thought would be quite useful and timesaving. Lastly, we learnt how to add content into grid and how to align and center it by combing grids and flexboxes. This video also helped solidify my knowledge of CSS and familiarize me with how it all works. All this added info will be helpful for coding my blog, and makes the whole thing seem much more achievable as coding the basic website doesn’t seem so difficult now.  </p>
