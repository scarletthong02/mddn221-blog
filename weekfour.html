            <a class="sub-heading">Planning user journeys 
            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">In this lecture we covered user journeys including user flows and customer journey maps and flex boxes. Journey mapping was something that I was already familiar with from Interaction design last year and in tri 1, so it felt pretty easy and straightforward to me as I had made them many times before I had also made a user flow diagram before as well but was not too sure why it was useful. For the lecture activity we created a user flow for Spongebob once again and the user journey for the steps that he would take when he uses a fitness site that suggests workouts and meals based on the input goals, we then created a journey map based on the user flow that would outline the steps he would take, goals, emotions and thoughts throughout the interaction. Both user flows and user journey maps are useful in wed design as they represent the journey a user is likely to go through when using your products, and helps to identify insights and pain points, informing the areas of the design that need improvement in order to better the overall user experience. Creating a user flow diagram before the design process is a good visualisation tool as it also helps to give a good outline of the website you are going to create. The coding task in this class involved creating a box around an image using margins, padding and borders in CSS. This was fairly straightforward, but it was good to get practice and get used to coding visual things.</p>  

            <a class="sub-heading">Flexboxes
            </a>

                <p class="blog-text">The prerecorded lecture video covered divs and flexboxes. This video covered quite a lot of new content that I imagine would be useful when I am coding my blog, particularly creating containers and divs which would allow you to separate and design each element within a container space uniquely but still keep i. We also learnt about display:flex which allows the elements to squash and stretch or move to a new line according to the viewing screen size, this is useful for creating responsive design that would adjust for desktop, mobile and tablet viewing screen and is useful to web design as it allows more people to have access to your website. The video also covered aligning objects which would be useful for designing the aesthetic of the website and would be useful for creating my blog. </p>
