            <a class="sub-heading">Assignment 2-1 Progress</a>
            <p class="blog-text">I continued to work on finishing my website prototype for assignment 2-1 mostly focusing on creating high fidelity wireframes. I decided to use a muted green colour palette to emulate a natural, calm feeling, referencing the sustainability element of the website. However, I eventually ended up pivoting in another direction after learning about low carbon design in Internet & social media design 201. Because sustainability is an important core value of my website itself, I felt that it would be imperative to make as many changes as possible to design a carbon friendly website, whilst still retaining a visually pleasing look. I did some research and used my prior knowledge about carbon friendly design, and I found that the more variation of colour used, the more energy consumed, and darker colours consume less energy than lighter colours. Therefore, I switched to using black for all the typography, nav bar, and buttons. I used a grey colour where possible to minimize the use of bright white. I also found that the more variation in fonts the more data and energy consumed. Therefore, I stuck with using only two typefaces across the site, lastik and degular display (regular). I realized that I also needed to create a log in page as well as a quiz to determine the users style preference to create a more customized experience. 

                On the home page I added imagery into scrollable frames, to create a carousel effect, which allows the elements I want to be accessible on the homepage and reducing visual clutter. I added buttons to each page and tried to keep these consistent in size and placement on each page. I kept the different pages as consistent as possible by keeping the same style and size of each brand ‘tile’, and I did more experimenting scaling and resized most things down. I also created several more frames that were intended to be pop ups, like save to collections pop up menu and a sort by/ filter menu. 
                
                I then continued developing these wireframes by adding in interactivity, I linked all the pages to the nav bar and to one another. I wanted to make the buttons more obvious by implementing hover states so that when the mouse hovers over a tile the outline becomes slightly thicker and the image becomes brighter, when hovering over clickable text an underline, or a perimeter will appear and when hovering over buttons they will change color. I also found it necessary to include a gallery-like feature for each brand tile so that the user will be able to see more photos from the brand without having to click through to the brand page, which I felt would make the UI process more efficient for the user and save time, I added arrows and circles on the images to indicate this to the user so that when the image is clicked it rotates to a different one. 
                
                I made sure to follow UX Laws with my websites design. The UX Laws that I included were Fitt’s Law by making sure the buttons were obvious and easily accessible Hicks law by splitting up the four questions into four different pages, rather than having all the questions on one page, this breaks down a complex task into more achievable smaller chunks, Miller’s law by only displaying three recommendations, and Jakob Law by looking at other familiar websites like Youtube and Pinterest as design precedents. </p>
      
            <a class="sub-heading">EditorX Basics</a>
            <p class="blog-text">The prerecorded lecture was on an introduction editorX. The video introduced the main functions of editor x and how to add assets like texts and images as well as how to set up a page by adding sections and grids to organise the content. This was a useful good intro to editorX as I had never heard of it before. I had used other CMS sites in the past and found that they were all quite intuitive and simple to use, however I had only ever made a web site from templates and not from scratch, but it does not seem too hard </p>
