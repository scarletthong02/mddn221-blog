            <p class="date">5 SEPTEMBER</p>
            <a class="sub-heading"> Assignment Progress
            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">Over the mid trimester break I worked on starting assignment 2-1 by sketching out the wireframes by hand. I sketched out the layout for my main pages and included the important content areas and navigation buttons, this included the home page, profile pages, search page, brand page and the trending, curated for you, and best rated pages for both the desktop and mobile version. I then transferred these onto figma by creating simple lofi block frames. </p>
            <a class="sub-heading">Colour Theory</a>
            <p class="blog-text">In this week's class we looked at colour theory. I already knew a fair amount about colour theory from my communication design classes and high school art, nevertheless it was useful to get a reminder and reiterate these concepts in the context of web design. The lecture covered contrast, hues, lightness, saturation and dominance and we saw examples of good and bad contrast. The websites that analyse contrast were helpful and I can myself using them in the future in many different projects. Colour theory is important to web design as it is essential in creating a visually pleasing web design with the correct hierarchy and cohesivity in order to make a legible website that users will find easy and pleasing to use. </p>
            <a class="sub-heading">UX Laws</a>
            <p class="blog-text">The video content covered UX Laws. I was somewhat familiar with these laws from my Interaction design courses, but again it was helpful to reinforce these concepts. The laws covered in the video included: </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Fitt’s law – making sure that a call-to-action button in obvious enough for the user to register and click on it in a short amount of time </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Hick’s Law – Making decision making less overwhelming for the user by breaking the task into smaller steps (ie by using a search filter) </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Jakobs Law – leveraging existing mental models and making your site look and work like already familiar sites </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Law of Pragnanz – using simple shapes (ie a circle is better than a rectangle)  </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Law of Proximity – grouping similar objects near each other </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Millers Law – the user can only keep 7 items in their working memory </p>
            <p class="blog-text">Parkinson Law – Making sure any proccess on your site is fast and easy to limit the time it takes to complete the task </p>
            <p class="blog-text">All these laws and more are essential to web design as they help to inform creating a website with a good, streamlined user experience, which will motivate users to continue using your site and help achieve your site goals. These UX laws have definitely helped influence my design proccess in web design and interaction design and I find it helpful to look through the UXLaws website when making a design to make sure I am including these. I also find it helpful looking a good pre existing websites as design precedents, not only to abide by Jakobs Law but also most good websites include many more of these UX Laws so it is useful to see them in action. </p>
