            <a class="sub-heading">Assignment 1 Progress
            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">This week I worked on finishing my assignment one, as I had an extension for the next Monday, I unfortunately missed the presentations. I already had an idea of the website that I wanted to create and worked on narrowing it down to a website that looks at analyzing the sustainability and ethics of fashion brand. So, I then thought of characters that would be good to base a user persona of and decided Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. The first part of the assignment I completed was the user persona and made sure that the user goals aligned with the proposed website, I then went on to create the empathy map. For this I relied on making assumptions of what Elle Woods, or any other user would be thinking, feeling, saying, and feeling. I then went on to create the Venn diagram. I had the most trouble with this part of the assignment, for the user goals I mostly transferred the goals from the user persona and produced the designer goals with what I wanted the website to achieve. However, the shared goals were a bit more difficult to figure out, but after referring to the lecture slides it started to make more sense. The next part was creating the user flow diagram, I started by creating the current user flow. For this I went through the interaction myself and relied on assumption. Then I made the ideal user flow, which would be the user flow for my website. This took much more thinking and planning than I had expected to figure out exactly how my website would function and work out the specific pages and interactions that I would have. I then created a user journey map based on the ideal user flow, as I had created several journey maps before this was quite straightforward, but this helped to identify the possible pain points of the website and helped to inform design decisions that I could implement within my design. After creating each of these pages I worked on the design of my pages, I wanted to keep this in theme with the character of Elle Woods so I decided to use pink and handwritten-looking elements and adding sparkles and stickers to make it look like it could be something made by Elle herself.</p> 

                <p class="blog-text">At first I thought that this assignment was trivial, but after completing it I realized that it was actually useful and important to shape the rest of the website design in order to make sure that you are designing with the intention to meet the demands of the user to create a user experience and website that people would want to use. This is useful not only in web design but also in several aspects of design. </p>
