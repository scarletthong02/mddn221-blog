            <a class="sub-heading">EditorX Fundamentals</a>
            <p class="blog-text">This week's class we had an EditorX example video where we were shown a run through of creating a website on EditorX, this covered adding images, and text, creating grids to display content, adding buttons, and making it responsive to different screens. This lecture was useful to familarise with EditorX for my website.</p>
            <a class="sub-heading">Thinking like a Coder</a>
            <p class="blog-text">The prerecorded lecture video covered a run through of a code example. This video was super helpful in going over all the coding weâ€™ve learnt this trimester and helped to reinforce the concepts of css grids and how to structure code and css functions. Another helpful part of this video was how to add in custom fonts from google. I will definitely go over this video when I am coding my blog. </p>
            <a class="sub-heading">Assignment Progress</a>
            <p class="blog-text">This week I worked on completing the final version of my website on EditorX, I started off adding in my custom fonts. EditorX could not access adobe fonts, so I had to choose the most similar font. I created the header and footer that would go on each page and created the main pages for my website. I then tried to create the scrollable feature for my homepage which took a lot of trial and error, eventually I figured out the repeater element and how to link these to a data set of dynamic pages, which was super helpful and saved me a lot of time as it allowed me to keep the same layout of the page but changing the content. I also made a search bar but could not really get this to work properly as editorX did not have the functionality to customise the search results page other than changing the font. I then created a member's area and made the profile page. I wanted to include my preferences quiz after the sign-up page, but could not do this in editorX, so instead I added a section in the profile page for setting preferences. I ended up using Typeform, a third party plug in to create the quiz, and embedded this code into my site. Overall, it was valuable experience making a website, but it ended up being a bit of a flop. I had never made a website from scratch before. There are several things I would change about my website, that I would if I had more time, or more of the capabilities eg the quiz, editing the search results page and the login pages but I felt this was too far out of my control for this assignment. I would have liked to be able to make the function of saving a brand to your profile possible as this was a large aspect of my original brief, I also would have liked to implement hover states for the images and added animations, I just did not have the time to figure this out. </p>
