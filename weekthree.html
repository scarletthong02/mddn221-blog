            <a class="sub-heading">CSS Box Model & Determining goals</a>
        
            <p class="blog-text">In this lecture we looked at user goals and designer goals and combining them in a Venn diagram to understand the shared goals, from the prerecorded lecture videos was about the CSS box model and looking at margins and padding around elements of a website. The concept of user/designer and shared goals was new to me. It was helpful to get into groups for the lecture task to create a Venn diagram, once again using spongebob as the example user and website designed to help users navigate the gym by providing workouts and meal plans. From this the user goals we summarised were wanting to improve his fitness, want to learn more about fitness. The designer's goals were to create a website that could teach people about fitness and a website that users would want to use. And so, the shared goals were to create a website that would be easy to use and easy to understand. This is useful as a web designer as it takes what a user wants to get of a website and what the designer wants to get out of a website in order to determine the goals that will guide the process of making a website. The coding task was to create an ordered list and an unordered list with links using last week's content which also helped with thinking for assignment one and choosing a character.  

                The content around the box model was straightforward, it helped me understand the differences between margins, boarders, and padding. I imagine this will be useful when trying to size and space things out when making a website. </p>
