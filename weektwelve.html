            <a class="sub-heading">Reflection over the Trimester
            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">At the beginning of the trimester, I had next to no knowledge of Web design, I had previously taken interaction design classes so had some prior knowledge on user-based design and I had taken creative coding last year, so I knew a little bit of JavaScript, but I had no knowledge at all about HTML and CSS. Over the trimester we covered a lot of web design concepts including user research methods, UX laws, colour theory, typography, using Figma and EditorX. As well as learning essentially code a website from scratch starting from how to set up a html file, adding text images and colours setting up flexboxes and grids and making responsive design. It is kind of crazy to think that I am currently coding a full blog website from scratch, when at the start of the trimester I didnâ€™t even know what a text editor was. The knowledge that I have gained from this course has been valuable as it taught me the skill of coding, but also taught me the process behind creating a website, starting from user research to prototyping and development, which I can apply to several other projects. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. If I could do it again, I think that I would have a different approach to my website, I still like the concept of it, but I think I would change the visuals of it, as I got sick of it quite quickly, I would have also liked to spend more time on the final output of it as it was quite rushed and turned out a bit janky. I think that I could try coding it next time.  </p>
