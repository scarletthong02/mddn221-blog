            </a>
            <p class="blog-text">Unfortunately, i wasnt able to join this lecture live so I couldnt participate in the group tutorial activities, however I did manage to watch the recording. In today's lecture we covered understanding user's including User Personas and User Empathy Maps. User Personas were briefly covered in IXXN201 from trimester 1, so I had a little bit of prior knowledge about what they were, but it was good to gain a better understanding of what they are and how to create one. I did not know what an empathy map was before the lecture. To summarise; a user persona is a "character" created based on parts of the presumed customer demographic, to help inform design decisions regarding a 'typical' user to improve the experience for real users. This is important to web design as it allows the designer to gain a better understanding of who is using their website, and what they wish to gain from it therefore resulting in a better overall design. Empathy maps is another method for gaining better understanding of users. Empathy mapping highlights the user's feelings and behaviours whilst completing an interaction. They can be split into four sections: says, thinks, does, and feels. This is useful when it comes to web design as it helps to inform the design as to the user's thoughts and feelings and identifies pain points and areas for improvement. I was cool how the tutorial task was based around Spongebob as it turned out to be a helpful example to understand creating user personas and empathy maps as hes a character that everyone is so familiar with. It was interesting to see everyone's take on SpongeBob as well. It was also helpful as it has made this lecture much more memorable. </p>
